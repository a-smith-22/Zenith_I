Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoyed! This game was developed by Andrew Smith from 01-25-2021 to 02-03-2021. Future patches are noted in the source code. All code was developed in Processing IDE using Java and the 16x16 pixel images were created using GIMP. All characters, places, and names mentioned in the game are purely fictional and are from the mind of Andrew Smith alone. The concept of the choice selection was inspired by Netflix's Bandersnatch of the Black Mirror series. The graphics were inspired by 80's style at-home computer games and use a display of 256x196 pixels as a result.
